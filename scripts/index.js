// Write a script that , when you click on the button,
// adds a new fox RANDOM image to the container div.
// All foxes should be floated.  Make another button to remove all foxes.

// Stretch:   Make several buttons that change the way the foxes are
// added and displayed.  Example:  a new add button would change all
// to display: block in the existing dom and add a new random fox which is
// also display: block.  Hit the display float button and they all change
// back to float and it adds a new floated random fox.
